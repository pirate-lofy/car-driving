# car-driving
This a prototype for a simulation of car driving application helps disables to drive their cars with only the movement and the position of their faces.
this a prototype..it needs alot of work to be better


# Structure
this project made of two main pars:
  1. a simple car driving game
      for this purpose I used a pre-made open-source game made by xpd54 (https://github.com/xpd54/Car-race-game.git)
  2. a simple object detection application to detect faces and measure their movement


# Dependencies
this application made of few components... u need to have all of them to run the application with no erros
  1. python 3.x - you can find documentations here (https://docs.python.org/)
  2. openCV -     you can find documentation here (https://docs.opencv.org/)
  3. pyGame -     you can find documentation here (https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
