# car-driving
This a prototype for a simulation of a car driving application helps disables to drive their cars with only the movement and the position of their faces.


# Structure
this project made of two main pars:
  1. a simple car driving game
      for this purpose I used a pre-made open-source game made by xpd54 (https://github.com/xpd54/Car-race-game.git)
  2. a simple object detection application to detect faces and measure their movement


# Dependencies
this application made of few components... u need to have all of them to run the application with no erros
  1. python 3.x - you can find documentations here (https://docs.python.org/)
  2. openCV -     you can find documentation here (https://docs.opencv.org/)
  3. pyGame -     you can find documentation here (https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

# Things to know
object detection module uses a pre-trained cascade for openCV.
You can find 
more about cascades here (https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html)

# Test
Only run file names game.py and start the game..

Via command line in windows, only run command
python3 game.py

Via terminal in linux
./game.py
